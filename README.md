## Ring Oscillator Measurements Spartan 3E

We have collected on-chip variability data of nearly 200 Spartan 3E FPGAs (90nm), designed functional prototypes of PUFs,
analyzed aging effects, and created improved entropy extraction methods. This repository provides access to our measurement data.

The analysis of the dataset is described in the following [publication](https://schaumont.dyn.wpi.edu/schaum//pdf/papers/2010hostm.pdf).
